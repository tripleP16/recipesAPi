# Backend Code Challenge

Welcome, dear developer fellow. In this test, we will analyze your general knowledge of NodeJS development. You will find below the instructions to complete this challenge.

## Description

This repository implements an API to manage a cooking recipe book. The API is not finished. Thus, you must analyze and implement the user stories below into new functionalities of the API.

### User stories

- As a user, I would like to store the cooking time (in minutes).
- As a user, I would like to consult the recipes by searching by the name of the dish or the cooking time (in minutes).
- As a user, I would like to create a new recipe.
- Given a list of ingredients, I would like to know all recipes I can cook.

### Other requirements
- Replace the "any" types in the code with valuable types.

### What do we value?

- We'll look at how you structure the application layers (outgoing calls, environment variables, logs, error handling), readability, and documentation.

- Improvement of the template code.

- Unit testing or any other functionalities that add value to the project/code will be taken into account.
